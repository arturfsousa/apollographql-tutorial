# ðŸš€ Spacetrips

Don't you ever wanted to travel the space? Discover new planets, new galaxies
and see earth from outside?

Your dreams will come true with `Spacetrips`. With `Spacetrips` you can book
future `SpaceX` mission launches, and travel the space as you watched on the
movies.

Not!!! This is a personal project that I've created during my studies with
the Apollo GraphQL fullstack tutorial [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

It's intent is to make me practice `GraphQL` and `React` to build web apps. I
strongly encourage you to follow the `Apollo` tutorial. If you have any doubts,
don't hesitate to ask me.

I've made some changes to the tutorial code to fulfill my curiosities, like:

- Changed the design
- `Styled Components` over `emotion`. I like `emotion` but I've never used
  `Styled Components` before, so.
- Implemented a real world authentication method
